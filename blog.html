                  I ran my first digital ad today! I chose to run my ad on instagram, thorugh my instagram business account. I already have an instagram where i post all of my artistic endeavors. over time id like to transistion this into a business gateway! my goal with this first ad is to get more people to view my profile. I chose this setting because my first goal as a business to build an audience of people who like my products and would purchase. So the exposure to my product is the main goal of this ad. I created an 'audience' in the ad creator. the accounts i chose to target were based on a couple specs, age, gender, and interests. the age range i chose was 18-65. this is very broad, but i opened it up in hopes to get some good data in a week of who is seeing my add and clicking on my profile, and what age range are they in? I chose to advertise to all genders! The clothing i make is not gender specific. I chose some special topics to target as well; key phrases include: "sustainable fashion" 'sewing' I am interested to see what the data reflects! I also chose to boost a post that i already made of a sustainable water bottle holder.Just to see how people react to this product because its very simple and less involved to make. I have considered making this product a staple of mine (along with the belach dyes). Ill check back in a week to post some results!

                     What would I like to accomplish proffesionally in the next 10, 20, and 30 years?
                  </p>

                     10 years: I'll preface by saying that I view life as an ever-changing phenomenon. The other thing I believe to be true is that the more I "know" the less I may "know". A man who knows all knows he knows nothing at all.  Given that perspective id surely like to say, I have no clue where ill be in 10 years. We could evolve into a multi-planetary species. or we could eradicate ourselves into oblivion. And I am such a go-with-the-flow type of dude, that id like to leave my answer at that. However, for practical reasons, let's assume that the state of our society remains stagnant. Let's assume that the "norms" of society we have now, are exactly the same as they will be in 10 years. in this nightmarish reality, id like to have established myself as a notable designer amongst an audience of people, whether small or large, I don't think I have a preference as to which. Ideally ill have my own studio, which will be a multimedia studio for all of my art endeavors. This includes space for all sorts of sewing machines, musical instruments, canvases, yarns, etc. And knowing myself, there will be a big dumpster, but not for trash, but for materials. If money isn't obsolete yet, id like to have accumulated a sufficient amount of funds and will continue doing so until I can obtain a large plot of land. I'd like to own this land, not live there on the bank's allowance.  
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     20 years: Once again, my mind can only wonder what our world will look like at this time. If the earth isn't tired of us abusing it yet, I would ideally in 20 years be a very established creative mind, not just a designer. a Creative being With a vision for everything. Architecture, clothing, music, art, community, culture, love, etc. By this time, ill have a large plot of land where I will be working towards complete self-sufficiency. I won't rely on anyone for anything, healthy food, clean water, clean energy, etc. I'll also be well on my way to building my own home. On this land, I will start a community, where people live in harmony with one another and with the earth. It will be a different way of life, but a more sustainable and free one. I will also begin to pass my knowledge and craft on to those who want to learn. so we can further change the world. 
      
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     30 years: By this time I'll be living in a huge commune full of people who I love dearly. We will always strive towards evolving harmoniously. We will have a lavish farm that yields plenty of good, nutritious food to sustain our physical bodies. We'll work during the day to build up the community and each other, and at night we will have wonderful celebrations full of music, dancing, laughing, and pure happiness. we will strive to be the change we want to see in the world. The ultimate goal is to become one and to resonate eternally.

All of my creations are completely unique and hand made by me! Eventualyl i would like to be selling my custom garments, as well as offer tailoring services, custom orders, couture fashion, and upcycling classes.

                     A company's business model will almost always be a clear indicator of how much success it will see. Your business model serves as the foundation for any growth of a business, whether it be fiscally or culturally. The key to success then is to be wise when establishing your business model. By valuing certain virtues over others, you can find a perfect balance that produces whatever results you wanted to see. When looking at any company from the business model lens, this balance is what I try to look for. As prompted, we will be looking at two very different companies here and analyzing their business models. Those two companies are Gopuff and Peloton. I will be analyzing them on the virtues of, value proposition, customer acquisition, revenue streams, and cost structure. I have a theoretical 1 million dollars that I will be awarding to the company that I think has a better business model.


                  </p>

                  <p>
                     Value proposition: Gopuff is solving a very scalable problem. What do I do when I want something from the grocery store, but don't want to or can't drive there? This is a "problem" so many people have! Gopuff is a very good way to solve that! It's highly scalable in America. It offers products widely available at most grocery stores for a small markup and flat delivery fee. And Peloton? What problem does it solve? I would say that the problem is similar to Gopuff, What do I do when I want to exercise but I don't want to go to the gym? You can purchase the Peloton bike and subscribe to cycling classes. Peleton is also scalable. Anyone can own a Peloton bike. Anyone with a bike can also access the special interactive classes through a pro version subscription. And there is even a cheaper subscription if you don't have the bike. I think that because the Peleton experience is meant to be on the Peleton bike with the Peloton subscription. That makes it less scalable than Gopuff. Peletons value proposition seems to be much more complicated and niche than Gopuff.</p>

                  <p>
                     Consumer acquisition: I'll reiterate that Gopuff is more scalable, and has a wider target audience. Gopuff offers products at a very affordable markup, which allows them to service all types of customers. Peloton has a niche audience, their transactional product the Peloton bike, is over a thousand dollars to purchase in full. Which is more expensive than other more average standing bikes. But they do offer a rental option. Overall, Gopuff has a better ability to reach more customers and service them.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                     Revanue streams: Peleton has a couple differnent revanue streams. The first is transactional. They sell a product called the Peloton bike. They also have a subscription-based service where customers can pay monthly to have access to the Peloton exercise database in a special addition to their Peloton bike. They also rent Peloton bikes (subscription included) to customers for a monthly price. And you don't get access to the classes by buying the bike, you have to pay monthly on top of buying the way expensive bike to use that service. They also have a bike rental option for a price that is double the monthly subscription. That includes the subscription as well. So it seems that renting a bike is the best option for most people. But long term its not that economical. Gopuff however has a more straightforward revenue stream. Gopuff marks up grocery prices on each item and takes a cut of the difference between the marked-up price and the in-store price. they also offer a flat delivery fee of 3.95! Their revenue stream is way more accessible to more people than Peleton's
                  </p>

                  <p>
                     Cost structure: This may be the only category that Peloton may have the one up. Peloton's cost structure consists of a couple of things pretty equally I imagine the cost of materials to produce bikes (variable), paying fixed costs like facilities rent and utilities where bikes and corporate offices are, paying employees to keep up the website, to produce bikes, to manage finances, to market, to produce fitness content, all fixed. as well as some delivery and ground costs. Gopuff is a two-way market, it attracts buyers and sellers and becomes the middleman. the only fixed costs they have are paying employees to keep up their website and software, and finances. The variable costs are based on the demand by buyers and delivery drivers. they have to pay the delivery drivers 
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                     In conclusion, on the business model virtues of cost structure, revenue streams, customer acquisition, and value proposition, it seems that Gopuff is overall a better business model. It's hard to beat an idea and value like that, especially since it's in such high demand. Plus, Peloton is very expensive and has a niche main audience. That's why I will be awarding GoPuff my theoretical 1,000,000 dollars. May they do well with it so I can get lots of theoretical gains!

                     Do I want to start a business one day? Yes, I do! I am an artist, and I love to share my art with people! I also don't want to work a traditional job, so the best option I've got is to start my own business! Through my business, I can sell lots of my creative endeavors! like paintings, home decor, drawings, digital art, music, and of course, upcycled clothing! As well as tailoring and custom clothing services. Eventually, id like to offer educational services too. I'd like to teach others how to upcycle their own clothing and reduce their carbon footprint and impact on the demand for fast fashion. The type of clothing design I do is efficient, low cost, and high margin. Which allows me much more financial opportunity to grow my business. The tax benefits of having a business incentivize me to spend money on my passion for art (and in turn my business). Although I am not big on money, I am big on helping others and changing the world. My commitment to doing right and evolving is what I believe will make me a better business owner.

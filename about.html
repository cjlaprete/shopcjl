      <h2>Welcome to sustainble, slow fashion, by CJL</h2>
      
      <p>I find creative and innovative ways to take old unused clothing, fabrics, and textiles, accesories, and turn them into one of a kind garments; custom made, and ready to wear. This gives my customers an oppurtunity to wear something that they are confident was ethically sourced (thrifted, second hand, donated materials) and ethically made (not mass produced in a sweatshop). An oppurtunity that VERY FEW clothing companies can truthfuly say they provide. I also provide customers and clients with the oppurtunity to wear something that is a one of a kind. No one else has these garments becuase i made them from pre exsisting fabrics, in the grand scheme of the universe, I happened to stumbled across. Usually to aquire something so unique, it costs lots of money, and you have to know the right person or connection. but not anymore! </p>

      <p> The fashion industry today is oversaturated with companies that mass produce items through the abusive exploitation of human life. In addition, mass production of clothing has filled our worlds landfills and waste deposits with old clothing, fabric, and textile. It also leaves a collasal carbon footprint. Mass production is trend based and encourages people to dress according to other peoples standards rather than to dress how they truly want to dress.</p>

      <p>It is not sustainable, its extremely wasteful. Why do companies continue to create new clothes and textiles when SO much already occupies our landfills? this is where i come in. </p>

      <p>Confronted with the over-capitalization of the modern fashion industry, i developed a new type of fashion design that is unique to my brain and hand. thus, i dub myself a upcycled fashion engineer! I use the term engineer for many reasons. the first being that engineers solve problems. the problems that i saw was loads of old clothes - 'trash'. i began to ponder how i could turn what i had, into what i want. so I taught myself how to create whatever i wanted using old unused clothing that otherwise would have been going to the landfil. i took trash and made treasure. in my mind, the purest of alchemical processes. And in doing this, i had created what i beielive to be a hot comodity! So please enjoy and shop at your leisure! contact my via instagram if you have any questions! Peace, Love and Positivity</p>
